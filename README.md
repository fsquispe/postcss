# PostCSS Bootstrap Scoping
This project uses **PostCSS** to process and scope Bootstrap styles, allowing the styles to be isolated and not interfere with other parts of the application.

## Features
- CSS processing with **PostCSS**.
- **Autoprefixer** for cross-browser compatibility.
- Optional style scoping using `postcss-prefixwrap`.
- Generates a `bootstrap-scoped.css` file with processed styles.
